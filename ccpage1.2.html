      <h5>Carbon footprint</h5>
      Data stored on the cloud is usually kept in the providers data centres. These huge centres could be located anywhere in the world. Many companies have many data centres worldwide, with copies of your data stored in different centres. This is in the case that one centre is targeted or destroyed, then your data is still intact.
So why move to cloud computing? On-site data centres typically require a lot of  hardware setup, software patching and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.
There are far more uses for cloud computing than just storing data. It is possible to create, test and build new applications. This can be done on many platforms(web, mobile and API) from any location. This reduce application development cost and time by using cloud infrastructures that can easily be scaled up or down. You can also create software and offer software updates to customers worldwide, regardless of their locations. It is also possible organise your data in different sections of the cloud. This then allows you to uses cloud services such as machine learning and artificial intelligence to make more accurate decisions for analysis.
A question that is commonly asked is how to go about choosing a cloud provider.	 The most important thing to consider is whether you trust the providers. If you are unsure, you can read reviews of the provider or ask existing customers their opinions. Also ensure that the provider is in a stable financial position with funds to operate over a long period of time. It is also important to check what support is available to you as a customer. Look to see if they give you a performance report and update on any changes being made. Finally, when choosing a provider, check to see what security methods are being used. There should be a comprehensive security infrastructure for all levels and types of cloud services. Changes to any application service or hardware component should be authorised on a personal or group role basis, and authentication should be required for anyone to change an application or data. Data centres should have environmental safeguards to protect equipment and data from disruptive events. There should be redundant networking and power and a documented disaster recovery and business continuity plan. 
Cloud computing is usually pay per use which reduces unnecessary storage. This helps the environment as when companies use the cloud, they are not using more equipment than they need.
